Building a mobile app with Google Sheets on Glide without coding is a straightforward process. Glide is a platform that allows you to create mobile apps from Google Sheets data easily. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Google Sheet
1. Create a new Google Sheet: Organize your data in columns. Each column will represent a different type of information, such as names, emails, images, etc.
2. Label your columns: Use clear and concise headers for each column.

### Step 2: Set Up Glide
1. Sign up for Glide: Go to [Glide Apps](https://www.glideapps.com/) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new app: Click on "New App" and select "Google Sheets" as your data source.
3. Choose your Google Sheet: Connect your Google account and select the Google Sheet you prepared.

### Step 3: Customize Your App
1. Design the layout: Glide will automatically generate an app based on your Google Sheet data. You can customize the layout by dragging and dropping different components like lists, images, buttons, etc.
2. Configure tabs: Glide creates tabs based on the different sheets within your Google Sheet. You can add, rename, or delete tabs as needed.
3. Set up actions: Define actions for different components. For example, you can set buttons to navigate to different tabs, submit forms, or trigger notifications.

### Step 4: Add Functionality
1. Use basic features: Glide offers several built-in features such as user profiles, forms, filters, and visibility conditions.
2. Integrate with other services: You can integrate your app with other services like Zapier, Integromat, or even add custom code if needed.

### Step 5: Publish Your App
1. Test your app: Preview your app in Glideâ€™s builder to make sure everything works as expected.
2. Publish your app: Once youâ€™re satisfied, click on the "Share" button to publish your app. Glide will provide you with a URL that you can share with others.


By following these steps, you can create a functional mobile app using Google Sheets and Glide without any coding experience.
